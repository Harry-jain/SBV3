- [ ] Verify code updates in other tab
- [ ] Send message in one tab
- [ ] Verify message appears in other tab

### Performance
- [ ] Page loads in < 3 seconds
- [ ] Code editor is responsive
- [ ] Chat messages send quickly
- [ ] No console errors

## Monitoring

- [ ] Monitor query performance
- [ ] Review real-time connections
- [ ] Check storage usage

## Troubleshooting

### If Build Fails
1. [ ] Check build logs in Vercel
2. [ ] Verify all environment variables are set
3. [ ] Check for TypeScript errors
4. [ ] Verify all dependencies are installed

### If Authentication Fails
1. [ ] Verify Supabase credentials
2. [ ] Check email is confirmed
3. [ ] Verify redirect URLs in Supabase
4. [ ] Check browser console for errors

### If Real-time Doesn't Work
1. [ ] Verify real-time is enabled in Supabase
2. [ ] Check WebSocket connection in browser DevTools
3. [ ] Verify user is authenticated
4. [ ] Check Supabase logs

## Post-Deployment

### Monitoring Setup

3. [ ] Or redeploy from previous commit
4. [ ] Notify team members
5. [ ] Document the issue

## Success Criteria

- [ ] App is live and accessible
- [ ] All authentication flows work
- [ ] Real-time features are functional
- [ ] No critical errors in logs
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
- [ ] Team can create and join rooms
- [ ] Code editing works in real-time
- [ ] Chat functionality works

## Next Steps

After successful deployment:

1. Share the live URL with team
